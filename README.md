# UnityRadioChill

## 🚀 Overview

UnityRadioChill is a Unity Editor tool that allows you to listen to any radio (you need to have a streaming link) directly in Unity! It works not only in the Editor - but also continues playing in the background on your computer. That means it will keep streaming even if you switch to Visual Studio, browser or other applications while Unity is running.
